# libFMOD ![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/libfmod)

A library wrapper for integrating FMOD Engine in Rust applications.
FFI wrapped in Rust code to make them safe, more idiomatic
and abstract away uncomfortable manual C interface using.

#### Installation

A crate uses FMOD development libraries version to simplify version match and avoid link-time errors because of
incompatible FMOD API changes in patched versions.

FMOD API version encoded in left-most major and minor components. But changes and bug fixes in library wrapper encoded
using patch component, such as `2.206.1` or `2.217.1`.

For example for FMOD Engine 2.02.06 you should use:

```toml
[dependencies]
libfmod = "2.206"
```

That means that if backwards compatible bug fix `2.206.2` is published, that will be chosen as the greatest
release for your project automatically.

#### FMOD Development Libraries

FMOD development libraries can't be integrated and distributed as part of this crate.
You should download and install it considering your current licensing option from:
https://www.fmod.com/download

**Windows**

You should manually provide FMOD development libraries for MSVC linker.
For the first time you can just put following files to `.\target\debug\deps`
from default FMOD Engine installation folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Studio API Windows\`:

```bash
api\core\lib\x64\fmod.dll
api\core\lib\x64\fmod_vc.lib
api\studio\lib\x64\fmodstudio.dll
api\studio\lib\x64\fmodstudio_vc.lib
```

And then rename `fmod_vc.lib` and `fmodstudio_vc.lib` to `fmod.lib` and `fmodstudio.lib` accordingly.

#### Getting Started

The simplest way to get started is to initialize the FMOD system, load a sound, and play it.
Playing a sound does not block the application, all functions execute immediately, so we should poll for the sound to
finish.

```rust
use libfmod::{Error, System};
use libfmod::ffi::{FMOD_DEFAULT, FMOD_INIT_NORMAL};

fn test_playing_sound() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let system = System::create()?;
    system.init(512, FMOD_INIT_NORMAL, None)?;
    let sound = system.create_sound("./data/heartbeat.ogg", FMOD_DEFAULT, None)?;
    let channel = system.play_sound(sound, None, false)?;
    while channel.is_playing()? {
        // do something else
    }
    system.release()
}
```

See more examples in [tests](tests) folder.
